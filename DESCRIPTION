Description: A simple approach to filtering out mutations caused by the FFPE
    the preservation technique. This  package utilizes Bayes'Theorem to classify
    mutations based on mutation type and the contribution of mutational signatures
    in mutational samples. It also provides performance scores on the classifications.
