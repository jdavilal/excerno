# Introduction

This package is used as a classifier for determining the origin of a mutation, specifically
for samples that have been preserved using formalin-fixation paraffin-embedding (FFPE).
This preservation process introduces artificial FFPE-caused mutations. The new variants
(mostly C to T type mutations) transform the origin mutation profile, creating difficulty
in detecting the original mutation signature. Excerno quantifies the abundance of the 
FFPE mutational signature and uses Bayesâ€™ formula to filter FFPE artifacts.

Excerno also includes the ability to simulate cancer samples by randomly generating
mutations that corresponds to the FFPE mutational signature and a mutational signature
from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer.

__Additional data:__

* Simulated cancer samples
* The FFPE signature
